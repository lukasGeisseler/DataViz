This repository consists of different examples of custom DV-Codes:

- [Timeline_stackplot](code/Timeline_stackplot.ipynb) is a jupyter notebook of a stack plot used as a timeline (matplotlib). It shows the duration of an employee (lengths of fields) and the role (colored categories) over time. This timeline is used for a big plot and, therefore BIG ;-) for smaller use cases, please adapt the plot size and font parameters. [Byron and Wattenberg (2008)](https://leebyron.com/streamgraph/stackedgraphs_byron_wattenberg.pdf) described the influence of different layer orders, and provided hints for better readability.
